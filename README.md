A package containing Java projects for teaching Scientific Computing Method course. 

The projects are:

## Pendulum 
This project simulates the motion of a pendulum using Newton's second law. It takes into account damping. The equations of motion are integrated using Euler's algorithm.

## NBody Simulation
The motion of N objects in a plane is simulated in this project. The motion follows Law of Universal Gravitation and objects exert gravitational forces on each other. This project is inspired from CS61B course on data strucutres. It uses standard libraries such as StdDraw for animation. The libraries can be found [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/).
