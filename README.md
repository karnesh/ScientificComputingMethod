A package containing Java projects for teaching Scientific Computing Method course. 

The projects are:

## Pendulum 
This project simulates the motion of a pendulum using Newton's second law. It takes into account damping. The equations of motion are integrated using Euler's algorithm.

## N Body Simulation
This motion of planets around the sun is simulated in this project.
